[h2]The problem:[/h2]

Many mods want to update the code in weapon.lua or player_primary.lua, and doing so risks incompatabilities with other mods.

Whoever loads last, gets to keep their code! That's not great.

[h2]The solution:[/h2]

This mod offers a simple interface for loading "plugins" on top of your lua, and modifies vanilla lua to use its mechanisms.

With [b]LuaPluginLib[/b], you can add a reference to your "plugin" to a local .config or .config.patch file and supported scripts will layer your code on top of their own.

[b]LuaPluginLib[/b] also adds utilties for adding hooks to functions, which allows you to execute your code BEFORE a function or AFTER that function is called.

[h1]Note! This is a Beta Release[/h1]

Not all vanilla scripts are currently supported. Please take a look at the [url=https://github.com/smartintruesdell/sb-lua_plugin_lib/tree/beta#readme]README on GitHub[/url] for details.",
