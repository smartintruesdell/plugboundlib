  "description": "Improves compatability between mods by creating a system of plugins for vanilla modules\n\n[h2]The problem:[/h2]\n\nMany mods want to update the code in weapon.lua or player_primary.lua, and doing so risks incompatibilities with other mods.\n\nWhoever loads last, gets to keep their code! That's not great.\n\n[h2]The solution:[/h2]\n\nThis mod offers a simple interface for loading \"plugins\" on top of your lua, and modifies vanilla lua to use its mechanisms.\n\nWith [b]LuaPluginLib[/b], you can add a reference to your \"plugin\" to a local .config or .config.patch file and supported scripts will layer your code on top of their own.\n\n[b]LuaPluginLib[/b] also adds utilties for adding hooks to functions, which allows you to execute your code BEFORE a function or AFTER that function is called.\n\n\nTo learn more, [url=https://github.com/smartintruesdell/sb-lua_plugin_lib/tree/beta#readme]check out the GitHub repository[/url]\n\n[h1]Note! This is a Beta Release[/h1]\n\nNot all vanilla scripts are currently supported. Please take a look at the [url=https://github.com/smartintruesdell/sb-lua_plugin_lib/tree/beta#readme]README on GitHub[/url] for details.\n\nWhile the mod is still \"beta\", the API may still change. When a majority of the base asset Lua supports the library, we'll go to 1.0 and the API will be locked to maintain support for all consumers.",
